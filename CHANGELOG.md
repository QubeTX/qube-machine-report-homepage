## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- `ExecutablesContent.jsx` About section now includes an additional paragraph between the description and the "Contains:" metadata: "Identical to the releases on GitHub — same binaries, same functionality, just downloaded directly."
- `ExecutablesContent.jsx` metadata line split into two lines with a `<br />` — "Contains: TR-300, ND-300, SD-300" on one line and "Platforms: ..." on the next — for improved readability on mobile
